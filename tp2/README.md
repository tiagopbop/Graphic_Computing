- Developed our understanding of geometric transformations and the introduction to 3d Geometry


### Initial Tangram Implementation

- This exercise proved a little arduous in the beginning as we were not accustomed to the commands and the use of transformation matrices.
- This meant that it took a bit to understand the order of operations and how to use them in order to get the geometric shapes in the desired coordinates.
- However after that, it was rather simple to complete the rest of the tangram.

- The next two exercises were made with relative ease, only requiring a bit more attention once again in the geometric transformations, mainly in rotations.
