## First Exercise - Applying Textures to Tangram

- This part of the work was mostly simple. For the first part we based our shader in two already implemented ones, varying and texture3anim. The only part that caused us a little trouble, was how to change the movement based on the offset.

- For the second part, we reimplemented sepia only changing the values of the colors, as instructed.
